# Sigfox Final Project â€“ Computer Networks I

A final project for the *Computer Networks I* course, focused on **Sigfox**, a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology designed for efficient, long-range, low-bandwidth communications. This repository contains a static website that educates and showcases key aspects of the Sigfox protocol and its use cases.

## ðŸ“¡ About Sigfox

**Sigfox** is an LPWAN protocol optimized for:

- Ultra-narrowband communication
- Long-range transmission (up to 50km in rural areas)
- Low power consumption
- Minimal data payloads (12 bytes per message)

It is primarily used in IoT (Internet of Things) applications where battery life and coverage are more important than high data throughput.

## ðŸ§  Project Objectives

- Introduce the fundamental concepts of LPWAN and Sigfox
- Demonstrate how Sigfox works in terms of architecture and data flow
- Highlight real-world applications and use cases
- Present network architecture and key features

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **HTML5** + **CSS3** + **JavaScript**
- **Static Hosting via GitHub Pages**

 ## ðŸ“š Educational Content

The website is structured into multiple educational sections:

1. **Introduction**
2. **Sigfox's Architecture**
3. **Technical Specifications**
4. **Applications**
5. **Challenges and considerations in implementing Sigfox**
6. **Conclusion**
7. **References**
